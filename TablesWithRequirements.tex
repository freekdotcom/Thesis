Run coördinator and SRC &  As run coördinator or SRC I need to give ALICE collaborators write or read-only access to the logbook. These rights will be superseeded by equivalent rights given according to the function of the user (e.g. a ALICE collaborator with read-only access will be given write access during the time of his/her duties as a shifter, subsystem run coördinator or system team member) (Roberto Divia).&6&13 \\ \hline

Physics Community & The Physics Board has several needs or questions:
1. To make the planning possible an overview of storage and processing
power (CPU) is needed.
2. The use of resources per user to run jobs could be more detailed.
3. How much PB is available on disk for storage.
4. For MC-storage a fine grained but lacks an overview.
5. When I want to clean up, where do I have to look?
6. MC production requests.
7. Usage statistics (which data is popular?).
8. Sort out why a train takes a specific time to process. & 1 & 13\\ \hline
