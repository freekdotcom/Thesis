\subsubsection{The ideas}

\subsubsection{Requests}

\subsubsection{GET}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Get request successfully
\item Get non existing single log entry
\item Get duplicate single log entry
\item Get all entries but without any entries into system
\item Get file from single entry
\item Get file from single entry that has no file
\item Get file from single entry, but the file was corrupted
\item Get file from single entry, but the server connection fails
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{POST}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Post single log entry successfully
\item Post single log entry with values missing
\item Post single log entry when someone has just create a single entry
\item Attach file to log entry successfully
\item Attach file to log entry but the process gets corrupted
\item Attach file to log entry but the path doesn't match the actual location
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Other requests}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Client wants to do a not supported request
\item Request with non existing token or a token created with third parties

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Database}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Database connection fails during request
\item Database query fails to succeed 
\item The database can be upgraded to a different version 
\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection{Login}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Client logs into the application successfully
\item Client logs into the application but the password and email don't match
\item Client logs in, but the client doesn't receive a token
\item Client logs in and receive a token, but the token is of the wrong access level
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Configurations}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The configuration file is missing
\item The configuration file is incomplete and certain features don't work any more
\item The configuration file that the users uses doesn't match the one that the back-end needs.
\item When there is an error in the system, the error gets logged into an log file.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Misbehaviour of client}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Client tries to perform a SQL injection
\item The file that is attached to a log entry is a virus
\item Client tries to perform an Http request for which the client doesn't have the rights for.
\item Client tries to change it's rights level within the application

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Different versions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A machine has a higher node version than the server
\item A machine has a lower node version than the server
\item The port that the server runs on is already used by another application
\item The port number is lower than one
\item The port number is higher than a million
\item The server can be upgraded to a different node version
\end{enumerate}
