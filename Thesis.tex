\section{Abstraction}
The abstraction of the report.
\newpage
\section{Introduction}
This is a student thesis from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences from the HBO-ICT-Game Development study course. This student thesis is made for the organization Software for Sciences. \\
Software for Science is an organization, at the moment lead by Dr. Marten Teitsma, that combines software with science. The organization works with Astron, eScience center and CERN to create software for their scientific experiments. \\
Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire, CERN, is a science research center in Geneve, focused on researching nuclear energy. This happends mostly with particle research, eg, shooting particles against each other in order to find out what energy comes free from one of those runs. CERN achieves this with the help of particle colliders. One of those particle colliders is ALICE. \\
ALICE, A Large Ion Collider Experiment, has its own bookkeeping system. This system makes sure that the runs ALICE makes are recorded into the bookkeeping system so that researchers, collaborators and other people can look back upon the runs.  \\
At the moment, ALICE is under maintenance. Subsystems and parts are being renewed. During maintenance, the desire of a new bookeeping system exists. There are three reasons for this. The first reason is that the new system must combine the bookeeping system with AliMonitor, a monitoring system. The second reason is that there are multiple desired functions that are not added to the current system, such as automated report making. The third reason is that most of the technologies and frameworks used to develop the system is outdated due to the fact that development started around 2009.\\
In order to make the new bookeeping system, the back-end and the front-end are seperated from each other. This was done due to the fact that the scope of the project would become to big. Another reason was that the front-end and back-end of the application will run differently. While the back-end will run on a server, the front-end must run on every computer at CERN. This thesis handles the back-end of the new logbooking system. The front-end will be developed by Naomi Nazar.

\section{Techniques}
This chapter will talk about the techniques used to create the prototype.

\subsection{Javascript}
The main programming language for this research is Javascript. Javascript was one of the hard requirements set by CERN.

\subsection{AliceO2/WebUi framework}
The preference of CERN is to use CERN's own developed frameworks as much as it is possible to do so. The WebUi framework is a framework to handle HTTP requests made by the client, in this case, the front-end. The base of this framework is the ExpressJs framework. \\
The ExpressJs framework is a lightweight framework for handling HTTP calls. CERN has expanded this framework with features such as Json Web token support, debug logger systems and support for CERN's own authentication system,

\subsection{Postgresql}
The main database that will be used for the prototype is a Postgres database. 

\subsection{Mocha}
The testing framework that has been chosen is the Mocha testing framework.

\subsection{Sublime text 3}
The development enviroment for developing the prototype is Sublime Text 3.

\newpage


\section{Methods}
This chapter discusses the methods used to solve the research questions.
\subsection{Database}
In this section, different kinds of databases will be compared with each other in order to find out which database would be the best choice for the logbook prototype. \\
What is also important, is the design of the databasej
The main cirteria for choosing the database is that the database needs to be open-source. Since the logbooking prototype is open-source, using a database that isn't open-source would make the prototype not open-source anymore. To find out which database is the best for the prototype, tests will be made to test the different kind of databases. \\


\subsection{Req analysis}
This section of the thesis will discuss the requirements analysis. There are over 120 requirements created by CERN. It is impossible to use every requirement in the prototype, due to scale of the requirements and due to time constraints that are set. An analysis is needed in order to check which requirements are nescessary to add to the protoype and which requirements can be left out.  \\
Inside the requirement document were some vague terms that weren't explained. The terms were follow-ups, on call intervention, announcements, and an EOS report. Iets over de features die er staan, maar onduidelijk zijn. \\
To solve the vague requirements and unknown wishes, a former shifter by the name of Pascal Buschoten has been interviewed. The full transscript can be found in the attachments. The interview with Pascal clarified a couple of terms like the on call intervention and the end of shift reports with templates. On call Interventions are emergency issues with a detector, a particle collider or anoter system that need to be solved as soon as possible. These issues need to be fixed within a very short amount of time. Currently, there is not a formal template availiable for the EOS reports  and because of that, all the reports do not follow the same structure. With a template, it is better to evaluate all the EOS reports).\\
A criteria for the prototype was given by Dr. Teitsma. This criteria was that all the requirements related to the Subsystem Run Coördinator must be added to the prototype. This criteria was crucial for the requirement analysis. \\
The technique that will be used is the Analytic Hierarchy Process technique.(bron van pakistaanse artikel die dit voor het eerst beschrijft). "In AHP, initially whole requirements are recognized and then criteria under which these requirements will be preferred. In AHP we pair wise analyzing  between  the  probable  pairs  of  the  hierarchy. 
Now users can recognize the possible relationship between 
the hierarchies. We then pair wise analyze them and users can select its preferences from the scale which ranges from 
1 to 9."(Javed Ali Khan, Izaz Ur Rehman, Yawar Hayat Khan, Iftikhar Javed Khan, Salman Rash, 2015). One of the main advantages of using this technique is that ""(Bron pakistaanse artikel). The second software requirements analysis technique that will be used for the software is the Hierachy Analytic Hierachy Process technique(bron van artikel die dit voor het eerst beschrijft). HAHP is a technique that creates so called planes of requirements in order to simplify the requirement analysis process. A plane is a group of requirements that are grouped together if they share a similarity. These planes can, for example, align to a user of the system or a feature that will be implemented into the final product. For this requirement analysis, the planes will consists of features since this will be more important for the prototype than the users themselfs. \\
Lastly, time will be an important factor for the requirement analysis. The time will be estimated using the story points technique. This technique consists of giving  points to requirements in order to organize the effort and scale of a requirement. The range of these points are:  zero, zero point five, one, two, three, five, eight, thirteen, 20, 40 and 100. \\ \\
Applying the chosen techniques to the requirements document results in tables with pioritized requirements with scrum points given to the requirements. The requirements are grouped by feature so that it is easier to read. There were numerous requirements that were double. In cases like these, the requirements were the same, but, the requirements were assigned to different roles. These requirements are grouped together to prevent duplicity. \\
The four most important features will be given and explained due to the amount of requirements. The complete requirements table can be found as an attachment.\\

\subsubsection{Entries}
These requirements are about the different kind of entries into the system(log entries, on call interventions, run entries etc.). This feature sits at the core of the to be delivered product and therefore has the most requirements attached to it. Due to the amount of requirements that are related to the entries, this section is divided into different sections for readibility. 

\begin{longtable}{ | p{2cm} | p{8cm} | p{1.5cm} | l |}
\hline
Role & User Story & Piority & Time \\ \hline
\end{longtable}


\subsubsection{Reports}
A requested feature in the new final product was the automatic creation of reports and templates. This is not availiable in the current product, therefore, there are a couple of requirements referencing towards the creation of templates and reports.
\begin{longtable}{ | p{2cm} | p{8cm} | p{1.5cm} | l |}
\hline
Role & User Story & Piority & Time \\ \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Email}

\begin{longtable}{ | p{2cm} | p{8cm} | p{1.5cm} | l |}
\hline
Role & User Story & Piority & Time \\ \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{View}
In the interview with Pascal, one of the things mentioned were the different kind of views. There were only eleven requirements related to the view, however, they are major differences between the requirements. For instance, some requirements are about showing different kinds of data on the screen while a couple of others are about the 

\begin{longtable}{ | p{2cm} | p{8cm} | p{1.5cm} | l |}
\hline
Role & User Story & Piority & Time \\ \hline
